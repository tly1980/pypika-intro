## PyPika Intro

[PyPika](https://github.com/kayak/pypika) is one of the most popluar python
QueryBuilder. I enjoyed using it, so and create a code repo for some examples
showing how to use it.
Feel free to go through the official tutorial from [here](https://pypika.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2_tutorial.html), and you can have a look at my [src/examples.py](src/exmples.py) .

All the example code can be found in  [src/examples.py](src/exmples.py) file.

If you wish to run the unittest, run

```
make test
```
